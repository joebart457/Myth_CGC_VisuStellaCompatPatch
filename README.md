# MYTH_CGC_VisuStellaMZCompatPatch.js

This plugin is intended to allow for use of MythAtelier's Card Game Combat engine alongside VisuStellaMZ's Core and Combat Core engines.
This has only been tested with the following plugin versions
 - MYTH_CGC_CoreEngine.js v1.6.4
 - VisuMZ_0_CoreEngine.js v1.87
 - VisuMZ_1_BattleCore.js v1.87

I make no promises that all features and/or plugin options for any of these plugins will work fully as intended.
This plugin is simply the code I needed to get them to work inside my own game. Proceed at own risk.
Good luck and God bless!
